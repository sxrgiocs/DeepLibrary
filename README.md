# Deep Zoo

DeepZoo is a repository that contains (or will contain) a collection of deep
learning networks, metrics, and losses for various tasks. The goal of this
repository is to store different deep learning tools such as networks, models,
loss functions, metrics and so on as I use them and verify them, to keep them
at hand for future use.

This repository is a continuous learning process, so things are not finished
neither correct, and will be updated as I learn.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/sxrgiocs/DeepZoo.git
```

## Usage

> **Important**: imports in the scripts are ABSOLUTE with the goal of being
> easy to find within the repository, so when importing functions or classes to
> a project, they need to be changed appropriately
